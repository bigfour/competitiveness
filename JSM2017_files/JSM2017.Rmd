## Goals: the NFL's

> There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain (parity).

> Carefully constructed system of competitive balance that makes NFL games and championship races so unpredictable and exciting.

**Roger Goodell, NFL commisioner**


> If you expect something to happen in this league, 
> itâ€™s likely not going to happen. 

**Jonathan Kraft, President of New England Patriots**


## Goals: ours

1. Develop model to assess parity in professional sports
2. Does the NFL have parity?
3. How do NFL *systems* impact league outcomes? 


## 1. Assess parity in professional sports

How to define parity

> the state or condition of being equal

**Google**


## 1. Assess parity in professional sports

What parity looks like:

## 1. Assess parity in professional sports

What parity does not look like:

## 1. Assess parity in professional sports

Parity checklist

1. Equality at a fixed time 
2. Within season equality 
3. Between season equality

## Building a cross-sport model 


Motivation: State space model of [Glickman and Stern, 1998](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1998.10474084)


## Building a cross-sport model

* $p_{(q,s,k)ij}$ is probability that team $i$ will beat team $j$ in season $s$ during week $k$ of sports league $q$, for $q \in \{MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL\}$.
* $\alpha_{q_{0}}$ be the league-wide home advantage (HA) in $q$
* $\alpha_{(q) i^{\star}}$ be the extra effect (+ or -) for team $i$ when playing at home
* $\theta_{(q,s,k) i}$ and $\theta_{(q, s, k) j}$ be season-week team strength parameters 


## Building a cross-sport model

\[ E[\text{logit}(p_{(q,s,k) ij})] = \theta_{(q,s,k) i} - \theta_{(q, s, k) j} + \alpha_{q_0} + \alpha_{(q) i^{\star}} \] 

Assumptions: 

1. $\sum_{i=1}^{t_{q}} \theta_{(q,s,k)i} = 0$
1. $E[\theta_{(i,q,s+1,1)}] = \gamma_{q, season} \theta_{(i, q,s,k)}$
1. $E[\theta_{(i,q,s,k+1)}] = \gamma_{q, week} \theta_{(i, q,s,k)}$
1. $\gamma_{q,week}$ and $\gamma_{q,season}$ week/season level autogressive parameters


## Fitting a cross-sport model

*Data*:  2006-2016 regular season games in MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL via Sports Insights

*Priors*: Uniform (variance parameters) and Normal (team strength parameters)

*Software*: `rjags` package in **R** statistical software 

*Draws*: 20k iterations, 2k burn in, thin of 5

## 3. NFLs unbalanced schedule

A summary

> 1. Small but noticeable effect (+/- 0.15 wins a season)
> 2. Practical significance given 16 game schedule
> 3. Alternative effects: divisional games
> 4. Future work: compare to other sports

## Conclusions

Does NFL have parity? Not particularly

## Conclusions

Do NFL systems push records to 0.500? Sort of

## Slide with Plain Text

Let me see your identification. You don't need to see his
identification. We don't need to see his identification. These are not the
droids your looking for. These are not the droids we're looking for. He can
go about his business. You can go about your business.

Move along. Move along. Move along.

What is it? Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi
Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a
more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were
the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark
times, before the Empire. How did my father die? A young Jedi named Darth
Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire
hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.

## Lists

1. Simple lists are marked with bullets
1. Ordered lists begin with a number
1. You can even nest lists one inside another
    * Or mix their types
    * But do not go too far
    * Otherwise audience will be bored
1. Look, seven rows exactly!

## Formulas

Formulas are rendered by KaTeX, https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX

It supports both inline: \(y = x / 2\) and displayed formulas:

\[ x_{1,2} = \frac{- b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
