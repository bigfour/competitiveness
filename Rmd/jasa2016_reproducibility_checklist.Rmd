## Data

### Abstract (Mandatory)
Our raw data was purchased from Sports Insights. Each observation is a game in one of the four major North American sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL) between 2005-2016, and contains the game date, the two participating teams, the final score, and the betting lines taken by Sports Insights before the game. 

We wrangled these raw data---stripping out duplicate entries, cleaning up team names, etc.---into a single master R `data.frame` called `bigfour.rda`. These data contain the betting lines and therefore cannot be shared. We have placed this file in a private directory denoted `data_raw`.

```{r}
load(file.path(data_raw, "bigfour.rda"))
dim(bigfour)
```

There are `r format(nrow(bigfour), scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` observations and `r ncol(bigfour)` variables in `bigfour`.

A derivative public data frame with the same number of observations but many fewer variables is called `bigfour_public` and is available in our GitHub repository. 

```{r}
load(file.path("..", "data", "bigfour_public.rda"))
glimpse(bigfour_public)
```

This data frame contains only the game result and the implied probability of the home team winning, based on the betting line. 

### Availability (Mandatory)
The raw data purchased from Sports Insights is proprietary and cannot be shared publicly. However, we have created a summarized version of these data that is publicly shared.
